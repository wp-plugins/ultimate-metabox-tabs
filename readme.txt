Ultimate Metabox Tabs allows for keeping your post/page and ACF options user friendly for your client with the use of tabs.

== Description ==

Ultimate Metabox Tabs adds metabox tabs to your posts, pages and the Advanced Custom Fields options page.
They allow you to easily allow tabbable and sortable metaboxes on your editing page so that your client can do less scrolling and more editing.
They're also inserted at server-time, meaning no ugly javascript forcing the metaboxes into the page.

== Screenshots ==

1. The tabs in action. This illustrates their insertion just underneath the "Edit Post" heading.

2. The second tab is clicked, it now shows that there is a metabox available for editing and that the content can be hidden.

3. The admin editing page for the previous 2 screenshots. It shows that you need the Div ID of the metaboxes and that you can also hide the content with +the_content

4. The tabs in action on the Advanced Custom Fields options page. Shows multiple boxes.

5. The second tab selected on the Advanced Custom Fields page, the other boxes are hidden, and now new boxes appear.

6. The admin editing page for the previous 2 screenshots again.

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'ultimate-metabox-tabs' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Click on the new menu item "Settings -> Metabox Tabs" and start sorting out your metaboxes.
4. You'll find the post types of which the metaboxes can be sorted on, as well as Global Options, which will affect ACF Options and all post types.
5. Edit the desired post type/options and procede to adding tab groups, to find out your metaboxes DIV ID, go to the page using it, and inspect element it.
